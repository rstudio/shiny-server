shiny-server 1.5.15
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Upgrade Node.js to 12.19.0.

shiny-server 1.5.14
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `iframe` based SockJS protocols were using a CDN copy of a JS library that no
  longer exists, causing breakage. Now an internal copy is used. (The `iframe`
  SockJS protocols should not be needed for browsers that are supported by Shiny
  Server these days; if you ran into this problem, please revisit the value
  you're using for `disable_protocols`, and especially try removing
  `xhr-polling` from the disabled list.)

* Upgrade Node.js to 12.18.0.

* Upgrade dependencies to latest versions.

shiny-server 1.5.13
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Upgrade Node.js to 12.15.0.

* Upgrade dependencies to latest versions.

* The `disable_protocols` directive now has `streaming` and `polling` options
  for easily disabling families of protocols.

* Now able to redirect R logs to the main shiny-server process's stderr, which
  is useful for containerized deployments and other scenarios where log files on
  disk are inconvenient to access. Enable this functionality by setting the
  environment variable `SHINY_LOG_STDERR` to a non-empty value.

shiny-server 1.5.12
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Upgrade Node.js to 10.15.3.

shiny-server 1.5.11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(No open-source release)

shiny-server 1.5.10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(No open-source release)

shiny-server 1.5.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix bug with listening on port 80.

shiny-server 1.5.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Upgrade to Node v8.11.3.

* Added support for listening on IPv6 addresses.

* X-Powered-By response header now reports "Shiny Server" instead of "Express".

* Resolve permissions issues when log directory is on an NFS mount with root
  squash. The `log_as_user` directive was intended to work for these situations,
  but would fail in common configurations. It should now work.

* `log_file_mode` no longer respects the process umask, and the default has been
  changed from `0660` to `0640`.

* Exit code of shiny-server process was always 0, regardless of the reason the
  process exited. Now a non-zero exit code is used if the process was terminated
  by a signal, or an unhandled error crashed the process, or loading of the
  shiny-server.conf config file failed during startup.

shiny-server 1.5.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Upgrade to Node v8.10.0.

* Dropped support for Ubuntu 12.04 and SLES 11.

* Support gzip/deflate compression for HTTP responses. You can disable this if
  necessary with the directive "http_allow_compression no;" at the top level
  of shiny-server.conf.

* Don't color log output if stdout is not a terminal.

shiny-server 1.5.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Dropped support for RedHat/CentOS 5.

* Use HTTPS for Google Fonts on error page, which resolves insecure content errors on some browser when run behind SSL.
  (PR #322)

shiny-server 1.5.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There were no changes in this release. The version was increased just to match Shiny Server Pro.

shiny-server 1.5.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix "Error: Can't set headers after they are sent." appearing in the log.

shiny-server 1.5.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Upgrade to Node.js v6.10.0.

shiny-server 1.5.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add additional configuration directives `http_keepalive_timeout`,
  `sockjs_heartbeat_delay`, and `sockjs_disconnect_delay` to allow working
  with very slow connections and large SockJS payloads. (The default values
  for these options are the same as in previous versions of Shiny Server.)

shiny-server 1.5.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Improve robustness with unfriendly proxy configurations. This had regressed
  some time between 1.4.3 and 1.4.7. (PR #263)

shiny-server 1.5.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Upgrade to Node.js v6.6.0, and upgrade all npm dependencies. While no distinct
  features or significant bug fixes result from this upgrade, catching up to the
  current Node.js release is critical for the long-term health of our codebase.

* Fix bug where R processes would not be cleaned up if an HTTP request was
  prematurely closed.

shiny-server 1.4.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Upgrade to Node.js v0.10.47 (security patches).

  SockJS connection, might result in a duplicate connection.

* The bookmarkable state feature in Shiny v0.14 is now officially supported.
  Use the `bookmark_state_dir` directive to store bookmarked sessions in a
  specific location (default is /var/lib/shiny-server/bookmarks).

shiny-server 1.4.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Skipped 1.4.5 for parity with Shiny Server Pro; 1.4.5 was a security release
that was Shiny Server Pro specific.)

* Fix a bug where a 404 response on some URLs could cause the server to exit
  with an unhandled exception.

shiny-server 1.4.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Upgrade to Node.js v0.10.46 (security patches).

shiny-server 1.4.3

  config option (replaces `disable_reconnect true;`).

* Upgrade to Node.js v0.10.45 (primarily for updated OpenSSL).

shiny-server 1.4.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Improve disconnected UI by adding modal with description.

* Added experimental support for reconnecting disconnected sessions. Set 
  `disable_reconnect false;` to enable the feature.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added experimental support for Interactive Documents (Shiny + Rmd) via the 
  rmarkdown package.
* Leverage site_dir when hosting in user_dirs mode; user_dirs will now respect 
  the directory_index setting and host static assets other than Shiny 
  applications.
* Provide a more sane handling of LANG by ensuring it's passed through in all 
  spawning modes and set an environment variable in the startup script on 
  Ubuntu.
* Bug fix: Restored functionality of sspasswd's `-v` switch.

shiny-server 1.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  the static pages generated by Shiny Server for directory listings or errors.

* Created 'user_dirs' mode and the special ':HOME_USER:' run_as user to replace
  'user_apps'.

* Support for node-webkit-agent (https://github.com/c4milo/node-webkit-agent).
  Use by setting DEBUG_PORT environment variable to a port number, then follow
  the instructions on the node-webkit-agent GitHub page under "Connecting to the
  agent". (At the time of this writing, node-webkit-agent only supports Node
