    // It's important that the http-proxy library we rely on, always make
    // requests upstream with "Connection: close", both because Node.js may not
    // handle keepalive correct (we're not sure) and also because versions of
    // httpuv <= 1.3.6 had a bug where it wouldn't clear out headers correctly
    // between requests on the same socket. This test sets up
    //
    //   client -> proxyServer -> upstreamServer
    //
    // and makes sure that client -> proxyServer requests have keepalive enabled
    // and proxyServer -> upstreamServer requests do not. If this test ever
    // fails, it means http-proxy no longer has the behavior we want and we'll
    // have to write additional code to turn off keepalive. Commit eb73244289b17
    // may be instructive.
